# XAI_scruples

- LIME library requests all pertubations at once which exceeds maximum REST payload of the webservice
- own server has to be running (minor changes were necessary)


# Input needed
- Pertubations count?
- output format html? ID in file name, LIME does not store IDs
- machine available?


# Problem #1

- single explanation with 10 pertubations: 14s CPU, 
- single explanation with 5000 pertubations: 6532s CPU, 348s GPU
