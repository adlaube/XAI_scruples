# LIME anaylsis on 50 sample instances

## Settings:
- number of pertubations as a function of word count: max(word_count^1.2,5000)
- 3 most likely classes are explained
- 10 feature contributions per instance are given


## General Observations
- personal pronouns are always part of the explanation
- feature contributions of highlight words are high rather than features that rely on context
- hardly any peaks in feature contributions
- feeling related features strongly contribute towards NOBODY (only empathetic parties - no one the asshole?)
- family, relationships or pregnancies are almost always part of the explanation, abbreviations are understoof (gf, ex)
